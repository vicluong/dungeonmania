# Dungeonmania

Dungeonmania is a 2D top-down action game where the player must traverse through a series of different dungeons. Each dungeon had its own puzzles, such as maze traversal, enemy combat, floor switch puzzles and more.

For this assignment, while my partner and I were given the assets and initial file setup, the majority of the game’s mechanics were coded by us and can be found in the dungeonmania folder. Mechanics in the game included making the player’s movement, enemies, doors, keys, portals, boulders and more.

Although the project is deprecated, I believe the code within it still demonstrates my proficiency in following important Object-Oriented Programming principles.
