# Dungeonmania

Dungeonmania is a 2D top-down action game where the player must traverse through a series of different dungeons. Each dungeon had its own puzzles, such as maze traversal, enemy combat, floor switch puzzles and more.

For the assignment, while my partner and I were given the assets and initial file setup, it was up to us to code the game. This included making the playerâ€™s movement, enemies, doors, keys, portals, boulders and more. All the code written in the dungeonmania folder was written by me and my partner.

Although the project is deprecated, I believe the code within it still demonstrates my proficiency in following important Object-Orientated Programming principles.
